# vim-Isabelle

Plugin for highlighting of [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) theory files

Install using a vim plugin manager. For example, if using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) add the following text to your vim-config:

```Plugin 'cplaursen/vim-isabelle' ```

Taken and adapted from a couple files in the [l4v](https://github.com/seL4/l4v/tree/master/misc/vim) repository

Isabelle/jEdit has been improved since I started working on this and I no longer feel the need to use vim for Isabelle, so this plugin is no longer in development.
